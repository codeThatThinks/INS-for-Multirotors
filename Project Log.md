# Indoor Navigation System for Multirotors
## Project Log
October 5, 2013 - Janurary 8, 2014

## Problem

Nearly all autonomous multirotors make use of autopilot systems that rely heavily on GPS and user-defined waypoints. Multirotors equipped with these systems have no ability to detect objects at close range, and since GPS reception is unreliable when there isn't a clear line-of-sight between the receiver and GPS satellites, it's clear that there isn't an autopilot system suited for indoor environments.


## Goals

The goal of this project is to design and build an autopilot system for multirotors that works well in an indoor environment or confined space. This means that the system must not use GPS, detect objects in its vicinity, and determine an appropriate path around such objects. A quadcopter will be used as a platform on which the system will be built.
